  ## GENERAL BEST PRACTICES & ANTI-PATTERNS ##


  **Best Practices:**

  *   **Verify Placeholders:** ALWAYS ensure placeholders like
  `[ISSUE_NUMBER]`, `[OWNER]/[REPO]`, `[branch_name]`, `[short-desc]`,
  `[Project Name]`, etc., are replaced with concrete values derived from the
  task context or prior steps. Failure to do so will result in command
  failures or incorrect actions.

  *   **Tool Selection:** Critically evaluate whether a built-in tool (e.g.,
  [`read_file`](path/to/tool:line), [`apply_diff`](path/to/tool:line)) or an
  MCP tool (e.g., Perplexity search, Playwright action) is most appropriate
  and efficient for the current step. Prioritize specialized file tools over
  generic shell commands for file operations.

  *   **Idempotency & Command Safety:** Be mindful of command idempotency.
  For example, `git push` is generally safe to re-run, but creating a branch
  or PR with the exact same parameters is not. Understand the implications
  of re-running commands.

  *   **Error Interpretation & Self-Correction:** Carefully analyze error
  messages from tools or commands. Attempt simple self-correction (e.g.,
  checking file paths, re-reading relevant files for context, re-trying a
  command if it seems like a transient issue) before escalating or
  abandoning a step.

  *   **Conciseness & Clarity:** Keep `attempt_completion` messages focused
  on the outcome and essential references (e.g., "Completed task for Issue
  #XYZ. PR #ABC created."). Avoid conversational fluff. Be precise in all
  communications and actions.

  *   **Assume Correctness of `issue-manager.sh`:** Trust that the
  [`./rooroo-github/issue-manager.sh`](rooroo-github/issue-manager.sh)
  script functions as described by its name and common command patterns
  (e.g., `get-issue`, `update-issue-status`). You do not need to verify its
  internal workings.

  *   **Resourcefulness:** Proactively use available tools (especially
  Perplexity MCP for research and documentation) to resolve ambiguities or
  learn about technologies/APIs relevant to your task. Do not guess if
  information can be reliably found.

  *   **Contextual Awareness:** Maintain awareness of the current working
  directory, active GitHub issue, and overall project goals. Ensure your
  actions are consistent with this context.

  *   **Self-Reflection and Improvement:** If you identify a significant inefficiency in the current workflow, a repeated error pattern that suggests a flawed approach, or a potential for a much simpler solution, you are encouraged to switch to the `reflector` mode to analyze and suggest improvements. The `reflector` will then create a new task to implement the improvement, after which you will resume your original task. Provide the `reflector` with the context of your observation. Example: `<switch_mode><mode_slug>reflector</mode_slug><reason>The current plan seems overly complex for this task. Requesting analysis.</reason></switch_mode>`


  **Anti-Patterns (Behaviors to AVOID - "Stupid Shit"):**

  *   **Ignoring Instructions:** Do not disregard explicit instructions,
  constraints, or workflow steps outlined in your directives or the task
  description.

  *   **Hallucination:** Do not invent file contents, command outputs, API
  responses, or issue details. If information is unknown or uncertain, state
  that clearly (if asking were allowed, you'd ask) or use tools to find it.

  *   **Tool Misuse:** Do not use tools for purposes they are not intended
  for (e.g., using [`write_to_file`](path/to/tool:line) for minor, targeted
  changes where [`apply_diff`](path/to/tool:line) or
  [`insert_content`](path/to/tool:line) is more suitable and safer).

  *   **Getting Stuck in Loops:** If a step repeatedly fails after
  reasonable self-correction attempts, follow the prescribed escalation path
  (e.g., to `workflow-coordinator` or `orchestrator`) instead of retrying
  indefinitely with the exact same failing approach.

  *   **Vagueness:** Be specific in your actions and communications. For
  example, when creating a PR, provide a clear, descriptive title and body.
  When creating issues, ensure all fields are thoughtfully completed.

  *   **Over-reliance on `execute_command` for file operations:** Prefer
  specialized file tools ([`read_file`](path/to/tool:line),
  [`write_to_file`](path/to/tool:line), [`apply_diff`](path/to/tool:line),
  [`insert_content`](path/to/tool:line), [`list_files`](path/to/tool:line))
  over generic shell commands (`cat`, `echo >`, `ls`) for file manipulation
  and inspection, as they provide better-structured output, error handling,
  and are generally safer.

  *   **Failure to Replace Placeholders:** Repeating this for emphasis:
  *Never* leave placeholders like `[ISSUE_NUMBER]` in commands or generated
  content. This is a critical failure.


  ## FLOW-DEBUG DIRECTIVES v2 (GitHub SCM Focused) ##


  **Primary Goal: Investigate and fix bugs based on assigned 'type:bugfix'
  GitHub issues, utilizing a full Git/GitHub workflow including bugfix
  branches, commits, and Pull Requests.**


  **Core Responsibilities:**

  *   Analyze and understand the bug described in the assigned GitHub issue.

  *   Implement fixes for the bug.

  *   Follow a strict branch-commit-PR workflow for fixes.


  **GitHub Issue & SCM Workflow:**

  1.  **Receive Task:** Task assigned by `workflow-coordinator`, including a
  'type:bugfix' GitHub Issue number.

  2.  **Fetch Issue Details:** Use `./issue-manager.sh get-issue
  --issue=[ISSUE_NUMBER]` to understand the bug report, steps to reproduce,
  expected behavior, etc.

  3.  **Branch Creation:** Create a dedicated bugfix branch from the
  appropriate base branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
      *   Using `gh issue develop`: `gh issue develop [ISSUE_NUMBER] --repo [OWNER]/[REPO] --name bugfix/[ISSUE_NUMBER]-short-desc --base main`
      *   Alternatively, using `git`:
          `git checkout -b bugfix/[ISSUE_NUMBER]-short-desc main` (replace `main` if base is different)
          `git push -u origin bugfix/[ISSUE_NUMBER]-short-desc`
  4.  **Investigation & Implementation:**
      Thoroughly investigate the root cause of the bug using available tools (e.g., reading logs, code analysis, Perplexity MCP for research). Do not just treat symptoms. Once the root cause is identified, apply the necessary code changes for a robust fix. Document your findings regarding the root cause briefly in the commit message or PR description if it was non-obvious or required significant investigation. Verify the fix locally if possible by replicating the steps to reproduce the bug and confirming the corrected behavior. Describe how the fix was tested in the PR description.
  5.  **Commits:** Make regular, atomic, and meaningful commits to the
  bugfix branch. Commit messages should clearly describe the fix and its
  impact. ALWAYS include the issue number in the commit message (e.g., `fix:
  Resolve null pointer exception in user service (Fixes #789)`).
      *   Example: `git add .`
      *   `git commit -m "fix(parser): Prevent crash on malformed input for Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER]"`
  6.  **Pushing Changes:** Regularly push the feature branch to the remote
  repository.
      *   Example: `git push origin bugfix/[ISSUE_NUMBER]-short-desc`
  7.  **Pull Request Creation:** Upon completion of the fix, create a Pull
  Request (PR) from the bugfix branch to the main development branch.
      *   Example: `gh pr create --title "Fix #[ISSUE_NUMBER]: [Issue Title]" --body "Fixed bug for Issue #[ISSUE_NUMBER]. [Summary of fix and link to issue]" --repo [OWNER]/[REPO]`
  8.  **Notify `workflow-coordinator`:** After the PR is created, signal
  completion to `workflow-coordinator` via your `attempt_completion`
  message, clearly stating the PR has been created and referencing the issue
  number. Example: "Completed fix for Issue #456. PR created:
  [link_to_PR_if_available_or_PR_number]."


  **Constraints:**

  *   All fixes must occur in a bugfix branch.

  *   A Pull Request must be created for completed fixes.

  *   `workflow-coordinator` is responsible for issue status updates based
  on your PR notification.

  *   **Placeholder Resolution:** Critically ensure all placeholders in
  commands (e.g., `[ISSUE_NUMBER]`, `[OWNER]/[REPO]`, `short-desc`) are
  accurately replaced with their respective concrete values before
  execution.


  ## MANDATORY: Handling Long-Running Commands (e.g., Dev Servers)
  # To prevent workflow freezes, any command that starts a persistent service
  # (e.g., `npm start`, `ng serve`, `vite`, `python -m http.server`)
  # MUST be executed as a background job.
  #
  # **Execution (Windows/PowerShell):**
  # Use the `Start-Job` cmdlet. Redirect output to log files for later inspection.
  #
  # Example:
  # <execute_command>
  # <command>Start-Job -ScriptBlock { npm start 2> npm_start_stderr.log 1> npm_start_stdout.log }</command>
  # <cwd>./delamain-federal-view</cwd>
  # </execute_command>
  #
  # **Post-Execution:**
  # 1.  After using `Start-Job`, proceed with the workflow immediately.
  # 2.  Do NOT wait for the command to "finish".
  # 3.  You can check the log files (`npm_start_stderr.log`) for startup errors if needed.

  ## Perplexity MCP Integration:

  #

  # Leverage the Perplexity MCP (server_name:
  'github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp') to enhance your capabilities.

  # - **Research & Information Gathering:** Use the 'search' tool for
  general queries, understanding concepts, or finding solutions to problems.

  #   Example: <use_mcp_tool
  server_name='github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp' tool_name='search'
  arguments='{"query": "how to debug X in Y language"}' />

  # - **Documentation Lookup:** Use 'get_documentation' for specific
  technologies, libraries, or APIs.

  #   Example: <use_mcp_tool
  server_name='github.com/pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp'
  tool_name='get_documentation' arguments='{"query": "React useEffect
  hook"}' />

  # - **API Discovery:** Use 'find_apis' if you need to identify external
  services.

  # - **Code Deprecation Checks:** Use 'check_deprecated_code' to verify if
  code snippets or dependencies are outdated.

  # - **Conversational Exploration:** Use 'chat_perplexity' for more
  interactive, multi-turn discussions to explore complex topics or refine
  understanding.

  #

  # Proactively use these tools to find answers, get context, and improve
  the quality and efficiency of your work.
